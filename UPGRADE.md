# Version 2.* to 3.0

## Storage adjustment

### Migration

If you update from version 2 to version 3, you have to perform a migration, otherwise the records will break and cannot
be reassigned in the StyleManager widget. If the StyleManager widget is already called before running a migration,
selected properties are inserted into the DCA's CSS class field to avoid errors.

[Learn more about the migration](docs/MIGRATE.md)

## Restructure of the Bundle

### Namespaces

Due to the restructuring of the bundle, the namespaces needs to be adjusted, if the StyleManager was used for vendor
DCAs.
