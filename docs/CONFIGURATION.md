After the installation, a new navigation item "StyleManager" is displayed in the backend to create and edit the dataset of categories and CSS groups.

# Categories:

Categories can be considered as archives and form a logical separation of CSS groups. A special feature for the display in the backend, is the merging of these categories via the field `Group-Identifier`. This field can be filled freely to display categories with the same group identifier bundled as tab navigation in the widget.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Title`            | The title of the category.                                                                                                   |
| `Idenfifier`       | A unique value. This value must be used to retrieve the template variables.                                                  |
| `Group-Idenfifier` | In this field you can specify an alias that combines categories with the same alias and displays them as tabs in the widget. |
| `Sort-Index`       | This field is used to determine the order of the categories in the widget.                                                   |

# CSS-Groups:

If a category has been created, any CSS groups can be created within it. A CSS group represents the actual selection of selectable options that are made available to the editor for the various areas (articles, content elements, ...).

A special feature is that CSS groups can also be used as template variables via the `Use as template variable` field. In this case, the selected options are not automatically made available as a CSS class, but must be accepted manually in the template. [Learn more about template variables](TEMPLATE_VARIABLES.md).

| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Alias`                    | A unique value. This value must be used to retrieve the template variables.                                                                                                                            |
| `Add search field`         | Activates the search within the widget for this CSS group. This setting is recommended only for a larger set of options.                                                                               |
| `Use as template variable` | This field defines the type of usage. When this field is checked, the variable is passed to the template instead of being used as a CSS class. [More about template variables](TEMPLATE_VARIABLES.md). |
| `CSS class`                | To further customize the display of the backend fields, you can specify a selection of predefined CSS classes. (long, clr, separator)                                                                  |
| `...`                      | All other fields should be self-explanatory                                                                                                                                                            |

### Configuration
Sometimes it can be useful to invert the component selection. E.g. if you add a new custom element you have to reassign every style to the new element. That can be painfull if you have a lot of styles. So you can invert the component selection:

```yaml
# config.yaml
contao_component_style_manager:
    invert_component_selection: true
```

If activated, you even have to check the main group (Layout, Page, Article, ...). But inside the selection for Module, FormFields and ContentElements the selection will be inverted. So e.g. you want to make the Style available for every Text-Element, but not for the headlines. Then you have to select Content-Elements and within available Content-Elements you have to check "Headline". 

> Please note that this applies to the bundle config too.
